Due to the specificity of molecular lesions caused by genomic alterations, we can generate characteristic variation spectra, called ‘signature’. This package helps users to extract (identify), analyze and visualize signatures from genomic variation records, thus providing new insight into cancer study. The sigminer package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;sigminer&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;ShixiangWang/sigminer&quot;) "],
