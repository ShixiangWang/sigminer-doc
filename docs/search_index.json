Due to the specificity of molecular lesions caused by genomic alterations, we can generate characteristic alteration spectra, called ‘signature’. To illustrate the biological significance of genome alteration signatures, we show some well organized figures here. Figure 0.1: The illustration of SBS signature, fig source: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3729 Figure 0.2: The illustration of SBS signature (2), fig source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05228-y SBS signature is previously known as mutational signature. SBS signatures are well studied and related to single-strand changes, typically caused by defective DNA repair. Common etiologies contain aging, defective DNA mismatch repair, smoking, ultraviolet light exposure and APOBOE. Currently, all SBS signatures are summarized in COSMIC database, including two versions: v2 and v3. Recently, Alexandrov et al. (2020) extends the concept of mutational signature to three types of mutation: SBS, DBS and INDEL. Here, we use genomic alteration signature to refer any kind of mutation type can be used to generate signature. Figure 0.3: The illustration of copy number signatures, fig source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0212-y Copy number signatures are less studied and many works are still to be done. To study signatures, we created an easy-to-use and scalable toolkit for genomic alteration signature analysis and visualization in R. We named it sigminer (signature + miner). This tool can help users to extract, analyze and visualize signatures from genomic alteration records, thus providing new insight into cancer study. Currently, sigminer supports two types of signature: SBS signature in the form of 96 components Copy number signature by the method either from Macintyre et al. (2018) or from our group work. If you use sigminer in academic field, please cite our work: Copy number signature analyses in prostate cancer reveal distinct etiologies and clinical outcomes, under submission Installation The sigminer package can be installed from CRAN or Github: remotes::install_github(&quot;ShixiangWang/sigminer&quot;) Issues or Suggestions Any issue can be posted on GitHub issue, we will reply ASAP. We have plans to extend other mutational signatures (like INDEL and DBS) to sigminer or extend reading input from other softwares, contribution is welcome. Preparation To reproduce the examples shown in this manual, users should load the following packages firstly. sigminer is requred to have version &gt;= 1.0.0. library(sigminer) library(NMF) Current manual uses sigminer 1.0.0. More info about sigminer can be given as: hello() #&gt; Thanks for using &#39;sigminer&#39; package! #&gt; ========================================================================= #&gt; Version: 1.0.0 #&gt; #&gt; Project home : https://github.com/ShixiangWang/sigminer #&gt; Bug report : https://github.com/ShixiangWang/sigminer/issues #&gt; Documentation: https://shixiangwang.github.io/sigminer-doc/ #&gt; ========================================================================= #&gt; References "],

["sbssig.html", "Chapter 1 SBS Signature Identification Read Data Tally Components Signature Extraction", " Chapter 1 SBS Signature Identification In this chapter, we will introduce how to identify SBS signatures from SBS records of variant calling data. The input data should be in MAF format, it can be either a MAF file or a data.frame. The signature identification procedure has been divided into 3 steps: Read data Tally components: classify SBS into 96 components and generate sample matrix Extract signatures: estimate signature number and identify signatures Read Data There is a famous R/Bioconductor package Maftools (Mayakonda et al. 2018) for analyzing MAF data. Here, we use the example MAF file stored in Maftools as input and extract SBS signatures from the data.

["cnsig.html", "Chapter 2 Copy Number Signature Identification Introduction Read Data Tally Components Signature Extraction", " Chapter 2 Copy Number Signature Identification Introduction Unlike several mutation types presented in current COSMIC database for generating mutational signatures, it is hard to represent copy number features and generate the matrix for NMF decomposition. Macintyre et al. (2018) created a new method to generate the matrix for extracting signature by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. The steps are: derive 6 copy number features from absolute copy number profile apply mixture modelling to breakdown each feature distribution into mixtures of Gaussian or mixtures of Poisson distributions generate a sample-by-component matrix representing the sum of posterior probabilities of each copy-number event being assigned to each component. Based on previous work, our group devised a new method which discards the statistical modeling and create a fixed number of predefined components from 8 copy number features to generate the matrix as the input of NMF, it is easier to reproduce the result, apply to different cancer types and compare results. To test if the method would works, we applied it to prostate cancer and successfully identified 5 copy number signatures. Currently, there are few studies focus on copy number signatures and no reference signature database for matching and explaining the etiologies. If you study them, you should do extra work to explore and validate them. Furthermore, the input absolute copy number data may be generated by different methods and platforms, it is normal that the contribution of some copy number feature components varies a little and result in relatively lower signature similarity when comparing different cohorts or different copy number profile generation methods.
