# Copy Number Signature Identification {#cnsig}

@macintyre2018copy created a new method to generate the matrix for extracting signature by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. The steps are:

- derive 6 copy number features from absolute copy number profile
- apply mixture modelling to breakdown each feature distribution into mixtures of Gaussian or mixtures of Poisson distributions
- generate a sample-by-component matrix representing the sum of posterior probabilities of each copy-number event being assigned to each component.

Based on previous work, our group devised a new method which discards the statistical modeling and create a fixed number of predefined components from 8 copy number features to generate the matrix as the input of NMF,
it is easier to reproduce the result, apply to different cancer types and compare results.
To test if the method would works, we applied it to prostate cancer and successfully identified 5 copy number signatures.
