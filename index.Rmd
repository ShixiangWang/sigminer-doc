# Introduction {#intro}

Genomic alterations including single nucleotide substitution (SBS),
copy number alteration (CNA), etc. are the major force for cancer
initialization and development. Due to the specificity of molecular
lesions caused by genomic alterations, we can generate characteristic
alteration spectra, called 'signature'. 

## Biological Significance of Signature

To illustrate the biological significance of genome alteration signatures (a.k.a. mutational signatures), we show some
well organized figures here.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The illustration of SBS signature, fig source: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3729"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/sbs_signature_overview_nat_review.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The illustration of SBS signature (2), fig source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05228-y"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/sbs_signature_overview.png")
```

SBS signature is a famous type of mutational signature. SBS signatures are well studied and related to single-strand changes, typically caused by defective DNA repair.
Common etiologies contain aging, defective DNA mismatch repair, smoking, ultraviolet light exposure and APOBOE.

Currently, all SBS signatures are summarized in COSMIC database, including two versions: [v2](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2) and [v3](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/SBS/).

> Recently, @alexandrov2020repertoire extends the concept of mutational signature to three types of alteration: SBS, DBS and INDEL. Here, we use genomic alteration signature to refer any kind of alteration type can be used to generate 'signature'.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The illustration of copy number signatures, fig source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0212-y"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/cn_signature_overview.png")
```

Copy number signatures are less studied and many works are still to be done.

## Sigminer

Here, we present an easy-to-use and scalable toolkit for genomic alteration signature analysis and visualization in R. We named it **sigminer** (`signature` + `miner`). 
This tool can help users to extract, analyze and visualize signatures from genomic alteration records,
thus providing new insight into cancer study.

Currently, **sigminer** supports four types of signature:

- SBS signature in the form of 96 (6, 24, 384, 1536 and 6144) components.
- DBS signature in the form of 78 (186) components.
_ ID (INDEL) signature in the form of 83 (28) components.
- Copy number signature by the method either from @macintyre2018copy or from our group work.


## Installation 

The stable release version of **sigminer** package can be installed from the CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sigminer", dependencies = TRUE)
# Or
BiocManager::install("sigminer", dependencies = TRUE)
```

> Set `dependencies = TRUE` is recommended because many packages are required for full features in **sigminer**.

The development version of **sigminer** package can be installed from Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ShixiangWang/sigminer", dependencies = TRUE)
```


## Issues or Suggestions  

Any issue or suggestion can be posted on [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ShixiangWang/sigminer/issues), we will reply ASAP.

Any pull requrest is welcome.

## Preparation 

To reproduce the examples shown in this manual, users should load the following packages firstly.
**sigminer** is requred to have version >= 1.0.0.

```{r}
library(sigminer)
library(NMF)
```

Current manual uses **sigminer** `r packageVersion("sigminer")`. More info about **sigminer** can be given as: 

```{r}
hello()
```
