# Introduction {-}

Genomic alterations including single nucleotide substitution (SBS),
copy number alteration (CNA), etc. are the major force for cancer
initialization and development. Due to the specificity of molecular
lesions caused by genomic alterations, we can generate characteristic
alteration spectra, called 'signature'. 

To illustrate the biological significance of genome alteration signatures, we show some
well organized figures here.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The illustration of SBS signature, fig source: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3729"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/sbs_signature_overview_nat_review.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The illustration of SBS signature (2), fig source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05228-y"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/sbs_signature_overview.png")
```

SBS signature is previously known as mutational signature. SBS signatures are well studied and related to single-strand changes, typically caused by defective DNA repair.
Common etiologies contain aging, defective DNA mismatch repair, smoking, ultraviolet light exposure and APOBOE.

Currently, all SBS signatures are summarized in COSMIC database, including two versions: [v2](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2) and [v3](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/SBS/).

> Recently, @alexandrov2020repertoire extends the concept of mutational signature to three types of mutation: SBS, DBS and INDEL. Here, we use genomic alteration signature to refer any kind of mutation type can be used to generate signature.


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The illustration of copy number signatures, fig source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0212-y"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/cn_signature_overview.png")
```

Copy number signatures are less studied and many works are still to be done.


To study signatures, we created an easy-to-use and scalable toolkit for genomic alteration signature analysis and visualization in R. We named it **sigminer** (`signature` + `miner`). 
This tool can help users to extract, analyze and visualize signatures from genomic alteration records,
thus providing new insight into cancer study.

Currently, **sigminer** supports two types of signature:

- SBS signature in the form of 96 components
- Copy number signature by the method either from @macintyre2018copy or from our group work.


## Installation {-}

The **sigminer** package can be installed from ~~CRAN or~~ Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ShixiangWang/sigminer")
```


## Issues or Suggestions  {-}

Any issue can be posted on [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ShixiangWang/sigminer/issues), we will reply ASAP.

We have plans to extend other mutational signatures (like INDEL and DBS) to **sigminer** or 
extend reading input from other softwares, contribution is welcome.


## Preparation {-}

To reproduce the examples shown in this manual, users should load the following packages firstly.
**sigminer** is requred to have version >= 1.0.0.

```{r}
library(sigminer)
library(NMF)
```

Current manual uses **sigminer** `r packageVersion("sigminer")`. More info about **sigminer** can be given as: 

```{r}
hello()
```
